      <p class="line2">I founded a Regional party with a National outlook and has a Pan-India
        support. JSP has a deep rooted base in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana & its presence could
        be felt in the bordering states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha, and some parts of Tamilnadu.
      </p>
      <p class="line2">For 2014 elections Janasena Party lead by Mr.Pawan Kalyan campaigned for
        the United front of Telugu Desam Party & BJP and succeeded in his campaigning by drawing
        huge attention from the crowds all over the state.

        in Andhra Pradesh state and thus for the establishment of Government in Andhra Pradesh.
